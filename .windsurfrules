# German Sentence Builder

## Overview

German Sentence Builder is an interactive web application designed to help users learn and practice German sentence structure. The app uses a drag-and-drop interface with color-coded and shape-coded elements representing different parts of speech (Nominativ, Verb, Akkusativ). Users can construct sentences by dragging these elements into the correct positions, reinforcing their understanding of German grammar.
